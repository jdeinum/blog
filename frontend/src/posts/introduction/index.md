# *Sigh*, another blog

yes yes, i know

## Overview

Hi folks! Thanks for checking out my blog. I have been making some presentations
/ taking notes on a bunch of interesting problems related to work and open
source stuff. I figured that because I was already compiling most of this
information in some way, that I may as well put it in a form that I can refer
back to when needed. My hope is that atleast one other person finds it useful.

## Contributing

Although I'd love to say that I won't make any mistakes, I am human, and will
undoubtedly make some. If you find anything that's wrong, please open an issue
on [Github](https://github.com/jdeinum/blog/issues) and I will fix it whenever I
can. I've added cards at the end of each post to make it easy to do so.


## Timeline

I'll be honest in saying that I am not really fixated on producing content in
regular intervals. Rather anytime I find an interesting problem, or am
researching an interesting topic, I'll do my best to put something out. \

Having said that, there are a few topics that I was working on that I plan to
release at some point. They are:
1. Clock synchronization
2. Code Quality Metrics
3. Digitial Idenity in IoT
